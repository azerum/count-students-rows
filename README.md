There are infinite number of students, boys and girls. 
Your task is to arrange them into row, such that no 3 boys stand
together. 

For example (B - boy, G - girl), the following row is legal:
```
GBBGGBG
```
And the following row is not legal (note BBB):
```
GGBGGBBBG
```

The task is to compute how many legal rows exists for `n` - number of 
students in a row

For example, for `n=3`, there are 6 legal rows:
```
GGG
BGG
GBG
GGB
BBG
GBB
```
