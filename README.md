We arrange N students - boys and girls - into a row, such that no 3 boys stand
together

For example (B - boy, G - girl), the following row is legal:
```
GBBGGBG
```
And the following row is not legal (note BBB):
```
GGBGGBBBG
```

Your task is to compute how many legal rows exists for given N

For example, for `N=3`, there are 7 legal rows:
```
GGG
BGG
GBG
GGB
BBG
GBB
BGB
```
